Vulkan Notes:
Setup VMats to be materials, rather than just shader pipelines (possibly rename to VShaders? and have that referenced by VMats?)

Object manager notes:
Could switch from sting ids to hashed string ids, so still input readable and memorable ids but not lose out on a small amount of performance

TODO:

+ Vulkan - (done, but needs further testing with when transforms exist)
+ Setup component system - (Done, entt covers it)
+ Create basic components
+ Make meshRenderer components interact with vulkan
+ Add renderables back when creating meshRenderComponents and set them up when adding the component to an entity or possibly scrap them and replace with just the meshRenderer component setup
+ Seperate camera object rather than the one made inside the Vulkan.cpp somewhere
+ lighting
+ more materials
+ improve scripts to work with logic loop
+ Remove euler angles?
+ Do licencing (Done)
